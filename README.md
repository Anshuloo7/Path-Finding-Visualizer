# Path-Finding-Visualizer
A Python Path Finding Visualizer for implementing the a* search algorithm. 
The purpose of this route-finding visualizer tool is to show the A-Star path-finding algorithm as it runs. 
This A-Star pathfinding technique is an informed search algorithm, which means it is far more efficient than typical algorithms such as breadth or depth-first search.
